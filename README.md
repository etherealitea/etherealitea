## 🌙 **Upcoming Series**
### **_How to Not Sob When Your Code Doesn’t Work_**  
a tragicomedy told through:
- existential error messages  
- misplaced parentheses  
- forgotten semicolons  
- and the small spark of hope reborn through `console.log()`  

✨ *episode 1 drops when my brain stops melting*


## 🌸 **About Me**
hi, i’m zainab —  
20 · cat-coded · pink panther energy 🌸💖🐾  

i wander between:
- baby pink & lavender color palettes  
- silent tabs of VS Code at 2AM  
- the soft belief that bugs are not mistakes…  
  they’re **unrealized stories** waiting for direction ✨  

## 💫 **Skills**
`uhh idk but somehow things compile?? ✨`  
- good at petting cats  
- great at crying over code aesthetically  
- average at debugging but excellent at suffering  

*(also Python, C++, JS but shhh that ruins the magic)*


## 🐾 **Projects (soft WIP)**
- tiny universes written in code  
- scripts that feel like diary entries  
- small experiments dipped in pink light  
- half-working things i’m emotionally attached to  

## 💌 **Reach Out**
if you found this place by fate,  
open an issue with **"Hey there!"**  

you MAY receive:
- a cat pun  
- a mystical snippet of code  
- a tiny tulip  
- or a lavender-scented haiku  

no promises. this realm has its own mood.


## 🌸 **Current Status**
```python
currently_executing = glam_up(miserableness)
```

🎀 work in progress. always.
