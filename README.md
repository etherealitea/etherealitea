> A secret corner where code purrs and tulips bloom.  

## Upcoming Series
*How to Not Sob When Your Code Doesn't Work*  
A whimsical, slightly tragic take on debugging — existential semicolons, misplaced parentheses, and tiny miracles hidden in the console logs.  

## About Me
I’m a 20-year-old programmer who:
- adores cats 🐾  
- sees the world in shades of baby pink & lavender  
- believes even bugs deserve a soft spotlight  

## Skills
`Honestly idek, but I press keys and magic happens ✨`  

## Reach Out
Stumbled here by accident? Open an issue with "Hey there!" — I might reply with a cat pun, a snippet of code, or a tiny cryptic haiku.
